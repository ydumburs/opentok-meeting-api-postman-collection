# Set up
1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) desktop app if you haven't installed it yet. You can also use [the Web version](https://blog.postman.com/announcing-postman-for-the-web-now-in-open-beta/).

3. Add your credentials to the imported Environment. Make sure you add them on `CURRENT VALUE`.  
The minimum required to generate a JWT is `jti`, `application_id`, and `private_key`. If you use Reports API please input your Vonage API Key and Secret into `vonage_api_key` and `vonage_api_secret`. You can add other values such as `callback_url` as appropriate.

- `application_id` = Your application ID (You need to create an application from https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications with `Meeting API` capability enabled.)
- `private_key` = Your application private key (Open the application page from https://dashboard.nexmo.com/applications and click `Edit` -> `Generate public and private key` then private key file will be downloaded.)
